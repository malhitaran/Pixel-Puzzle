# Pixel Puzzle 🎮🧩

Pixel Puzzle is a memory and pattern-copying game written entirely in low-level **STUMP** assembly, running on a custom STUMP processor and peripheral board.

You’re briefly shown a random target pattern on the 8×8 LED matrix. Your job is to recreate that pattern by moving a cursor around the grid and toggling pixels on or off. As levels increase, more pixels are added to the pattern and the game becomes harder.

> This repo contains my **COMP22111 Exercise 3** submission, which achieved a **96%** mark.

## How the Game Works

- At the start of each level, a **random target pattern** is displayed on the LED matrix.
- The pattern is also stored in a **level memory table** in RAM.
- You move a cursor over the 8×8 grid and **toggle pixels on/off** to build your guess.
- Each selected pixel is tracked in a separate **user selection table**.
- Pressing `#` (**submit**) compares both tables:
  - ✅ Pixels you selected **and** that belong to the pattern stay **red**.
  - ❌ Pixels you **missed** (not selected but part of the pattern) are shown in **green**.
  - ❌ Pixels you selected that **weren’t** in the pattern flash **red/black**.
- If the tables match exactly, you advance to the next level (with more pixels).
- You can perform a **hard reset** at any time with **switch SW-D**, which:
  - Resets the level counter to 1  
  - Clears both memory tables and the matrix  
  - Restores the intro screen

## Controls

All movement & actions use the keypad:

- `2` – Move **up**
- `8` – Move **down**
- `4` – Move **left**
- `6` – Move **right**
- `5` – **Toggle/select** the current pixel
- `#` – **Submit** your pattern (check for win / show fail feedback)
- **SW-D** (on the switch bank) – **Hard reset** back to level 1

## Project Structure

This repository follows the structure provided for the exercise:

- **`Exercise3/pixel_puzzel.s`**  
  Main source file containing all core game logic and table definitions.

- **`Exercise3/pixel_puzzle.kmd`**  
  Board configuration file for the CAD toolchain.

## Main Game Logic

The core loop follows the execution cycle documented in the `GAME LOGIC` comments in `pixel_puzzel.s`.

The game loop is split into numbered stages, matching the comments in `pixel_puzzel.s`.

### Stage Overview

#### [0] RESET / INIT
- Clears the LED matrix to black.
- If `LEVEL_COUNTER > 1`, clears the user/level position tables before continuing.
- Sets up initial variables and jumps into the appropriate init display:
  - Level 1 → animated “PIXEL / PUZZLE” intro + “PRESS ANY KEY”.
  - Level > 1 → simple LCD showing the current level number.

#### [1] INIT DISPLAY
- Uses the LCD to show either:
  - An animated title screen (`PIXEL` sweeps left → right, `PUZZLE` right → left), then a “PRESS ANY KEY” prompt, or
  - The current level number for levels 2+.
- Waits for a clean key press/release sequence before starting the level.

#### [2] DISPLAY LEVEL
- Uses the free-running counter (FRC) and a 6-bit mask to generate random indices `0–63`.
- Maps each index to an LED matrix address and the corresponding entry in the level table.
- Ensures no duplicates: if a slot is already `1`, it re-rolls.
- For each new pattern pixel:
  - Lights the matrix pixel red.
  - Plays a note via `SOUND_ADDR`.
  - Stores `1` in the corresponding `LEVEL_POSITIONS_TABLE` entry.
- After all pixels for this level have been shown, clears the matrix and jumps to input.

#### [3] ASSESSING USER INPUT
- Polls the keypad, debounces by waiting for it to return to zero.
- Decodes the key into:
  - Movement (up/down/left/right) → update cursor position.
  - Select (`5`) → toggle current cell in the user selection table and update colour.
  - Submit (`#`) → jump to verification (PASS/FAIL).

#### [4] DRAW PIXEL
- Moves the cursor within the defined bounds, guarding against leaving the 8×8 grid.
- Uses the `CHECK` routine and memory tables to:
  - Prevent recolouring a pixel that’s already selected when appropriate.
  - Ensure previous and current positions are tracked correctly.
- Writes the actual LED colour (white/red/black) to the matrix.

#### [5] VERIFY
- Maps the current cursor position into the correct row block (`POS_0–63`) using bound tables.
- Depending on whether the entry in the user table is `0` or `1`, control is sent to:
  - Add the selection to the table and paint red, or
  - Remove the selection and paint white.
- Uses a jump-table and “trampoline” branches to minimise duplicated movement logic.

#### [6] CHECK FOR WIN
- Compares all 64 entries of:
  - `SELECTED_POSITIONS_TABLE`
  - `LEVEL_POSITIONS_TABLE`
- If every entry matches:
  - Increments `LEVEL_COUNTER`.
  - Jumps back to `RESET` to start the next, harder level.

#### [6] OTHERWISE FAIL
- If any entry differs:
  - Correct selected pixels remain red.
  - Missed correct pixels (`SEL=0, LEV=1`) turn and stay green.
  - Extra selected pixels (`SEL=1, LEV=0`) repeatedly flash red ↔ black.
  - The SW-LEDs display an “L” pattern to indicate loss.
- The game stays in this flashing state until **SW-D** is pressed.
- On hard reset:
  - `LEVEL_COUNTER` is set back to 1.
  - All position tables and peripherals are cleared.
  - Control jumps to `RESET` to restart from level 1.

### Implementation Highlights

- **Memory-mapped tables** for colours, addresses, keypad codes, positions and variables make the code data-driven and compact.
- **Jump tables** (for resets, near jumps and branch targets) let the program overwrite `PC` indirectly via `R7`, avoiding long chains of conditional branches.
- **Table-driven failure visualisation** handles all three cases (correct / missed / extra) by reading the `SEL` and `LEV` tables instead of hard-coding coordinates.
- Heavy reuse of **delay and movement routines** keeps the STUMP assembly reasonably small and maintainable for a feature-rich game.
