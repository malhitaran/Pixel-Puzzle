# Pixel Puzzle 🎮🧩

Pixel Puzzle is a simple pattern-copying game: you’re shown a target pixel pattern, and your goal is to recreate it by toggling pixels on the grid until your board matches the target.

## How the Game Works

- A target pattern is displayed.
- You move around the grid and toggle pixels on/off.
- The objective is to match the target pattern as efficiently as possible.

## How to Run

This project was built for a university exercise environment.

**Typical workflow:**
1. Open the project in the provided simulator/toolchain for the module/course.
2. Assemble/build `pixel_puzzel.s`.
3. Run the program and follow the on-screen output/controls.

> If you want, tell me what tool you run it with (e.g., ModelSim / a custom emulator / etc.) and I’ll replace this section with exact commands.
